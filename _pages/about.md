Hi, my name is Ryan O'Riordan. I am currently a SOC Analyst at eSentire and a dedicated MSc Cyber-Security student. My passions lie in Malware Analysis, Incident Investigations, and all things cybersecurity. I have a keen passion for tracking threats and a knack for spending countless hours on discovering useless information that I can't share with anyone..

Since I tossed my graduation cap into the air in 2023, life's been like a sitcom episode. I went from being a regular grad to a full-fledged MSc student, all while managing to snag the prestigious Blue Team Level 1 certification â€“ no small feat, I assure you! So, here I am, not just learning the ropes but also untangling the wires of my own life.

With this blog, my aim is to broaden my own understanding of these subjects, recognizing that I'm far from being an expert myself.
