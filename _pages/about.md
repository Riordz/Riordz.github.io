I’m Ryan O Riordan, but most people call me “Riordz.” I used to work as a Senior Analyst at an MSSP, and now I’m part of a CSIRT team working as an Incident Response Analyst. I really enjoy incident handling and malware analysis — there’s something satisfying about digging into an incident and figuring out exactly what happened.

I’m also pursuing an MSc to keep sharpening my skills and knowledge. Along the way, I’ve earned my BTL1 and BTL2 certifications, which have been valuable in my work.

This site is where I share insights, tools, and tips from my experience. Thanks for visiting — feel free to reach out or take a look around!
